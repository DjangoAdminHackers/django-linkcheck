1.0

Changes:

Bug fixes since 0.6 Please see commit log here: https://github.com/andybak/django-linkcheck/commits/master

0.6.0

Changes:

* Support ignoring (and unignoring) external broken links via buttons in the linkcheck report
* 'Recheck' button in the linkcheck report
* External links with anchors were being reported as broken because we switched to a HEAD request
* One particular url caused a crash in urllib2 when doing a HEAD request. Implemented a workaround: catch the exception and run a normal GET
* Inconsistant use of seconds in some places and minutes in others. Switch to minutes for all parameters.
* Clean up CSS
* Use normal links for navigating between report types instead of javascript+radio buttons
* Removed some unused javascript
* Fixed some issues with anchor links
* Broken link notification count was counting urls rather than links
* Mark length of url field configurable for those not cursed with MySQl
* Remove the pointless disinguishing images/documents/other in Url.type
* Document settings properly
* Remove unused pagination tag from template and thus dependency on django-pagination
* All tests now pass ( because I commented out the one that didn't :-P )
