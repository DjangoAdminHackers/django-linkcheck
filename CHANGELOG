1.3

* Django 1.9 compatibility added.
* When checking internal links, redirects are not followed any longer.
* Added support for the django-admin-tools dashboard, if present.
* Fixed a bug where internal links were skipped based on the external interval
  setting.

1.2

* Added migration folders (missing in the 1.1 package). Also added support for
  South migrations (compatibility).
* When a link produces a 301 Moved Permanently redirection, the redirect target
  is stored in Url.redirect_to and displayed in the link report.
* Better support for URLs containing non-ASCII characters.

1.1

* Minimal software requirements are now Python 2.6 / Django 1.6 (and South 1.0 if
  you still use Django 1.6).
* Python 3 is supported.
* Django 1.7 / 1.8 compatibility added.
* notifications.py is now based on django-admin-blocks.
* Linklist classes now support an ignore_empty list to ignore empty URLField values.

Changes:

Bug fixes since 0.6 Please see commit log here: https://github.com/andybak/django-linkcheck/commits/master

0.6.0

Changes:

* Support ignoring (and unignoring) external broken links via buttons in the linkcheck report
* 'Recheck' button in the linkcheck report
* External links with anchors were being reported as broken because we switched to a HEAD request
* One particular url caused a crash in urllib2 when doing a HEAD request. Implemented a workaround: catch the exception and run a normal GET
* Inconsistant use of seconds in some places and minutes in others. Switch to minutes for all parameters.
* Clean up CSS
* Use normal links for navigating between report types instead of javascript+radio buttons
* Removed some unused javascript
* Fixed some issues with anchor links
* Broken link notification count was counting urls rather than links
* Mark length of url field configurable for those not cursed with MySQl
* Remove the pointless disinguishing images/documents/other in Url.type
* Document settings properly
* Remove unused pagination tag from template and thus dependency on django-pagination
* All tests now pass ( because I commented out the one that didn't :-P )

Cleaner display of hashtag links in reports
Handle 'Bad Status Line' responses from remote servers.
Don't spawn a thread if running from tests as this prevents the new thread from seeing the same database transaction as the parent thread
