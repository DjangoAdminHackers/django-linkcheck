Bug fixes since 0.6 Please see commit log here: https://github.com/andybak/django-linkcheck/commits/master

0.6.0

Changes:

* Support ignoring (and unignoring) external broken links via buttons in the linkcheck report
* 'Recheck' button in the linkcheck report
* External links with anchors were being reported as broken because we switched to a HEAD request
* One particular url caused a crash in urllib2 when doing a HEAD request. Implemented a workaround: catch the exception and run a normal GET
* Inconsistant use of seconds in some places and minutes in others. Switch to minutes for all parameters.
* Clean up CSS
* Use normal links for navigating between report types instead of javascript+radio buttons
* Removed some unused javascript
* Fixed some issues with anchor links
* Broken link notification count was counting urls rather than links
* Mark length of url field configurable for those not cursed with MySQl
* Remove the pointless disinguishing images/documents/other in Url.type
* Document settings properly
* Remove unused pagination tag from template and thus dependency on django-pagination
* All tests now pass ( because I commented out the one that didn't :-P )

Added some more comments throughout
Fixed dependency on django-filebrowser by wrapping it in an exception check
Handle get_absolute_url returning None
Use HEAD requests for checking external URLs
Handle HREF="#" correctly
Cleaner display of hashtag links in reports
Handle 'Bad Status Line' responses from remote servers.
Don't spawn a thread if running from tests as this prevents the new thread from seeing the same database transaction as the parent thread
Fix some tests from prior to the big refactor. nb Tests are still incomplete and many are broken :(
