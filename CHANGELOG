1.8.1 (2021-04-01)

* The 1.8 release contained unwanted temporary stuff and was
  therefore a broken release. Many thanks to Stefan Borer for
  noticing that.

1.8 (2021-02-25)

* Added explicit `listeners.register_listeners` and
  `listeners.unregister_listeners` functions.
* Added `listeners.enable_listeners` and `listeners.disable_listeners` context
  managers.
* Avoid crash when looking for anchors in response content.
* Avoid possible failures when checking internal links depending on
  ALLOWED_HOSTS setting.
* Confirmed compatibility with Django 3.1.
* Dropped support for Python 3.4.

1.7 (2020-01-13)

* Dropped support for Python 2 and Django < 1.11.
* Added support for Django 3.0.
* Made more usage of the requests library.

1.6 (2019-03-20)

* Use requests library when getting 'certificate verify failed' errors.
* Fixed compatibility issues with newer versions of Django.
* Fixed pip installation issues with encoding errors (#87).

1.5 (2017-09-16)

* Added support for `tel:` links.
* For redirecting links, linkcheck now reports the status of the redirect
  target (#78).
* Dropped South migrations.
* 'Url.redirect_to' was migrated to a TextField to not limit its length (#75).
* Fixed handling of the '--limit' argument of the 'checklinks' command (#73).
* Fixed the task queue of links to check (#69).

1.4 (2017-01-13)

* Dropped support for Django 1.6 and Django 1.7, the minimal Python version is
  now Python 2.7. Django 1.10 is also supported.
* Listeners registration and post_delete signal are now happening in the app
  config ready() method. This means that the process can be customized by
  having custom AppConfig classes and referring to those classes in the
  INSTALLED_APPS setting.
* A new DISABLE_LISTENERS setting has been added to ease deactivation of
  listeners registration.
* A task queue is now used to process link checking, so as to prevent exhaustion
  of available threads during massive updates.

1.3 (2016-06-05)

* Django 1.9 compatibility added.
* When checking internal links, redirects are not followed any longer.
* Added support for the django-admin-tools dashboard, if present.
* Fixed a bug where internal links were skipped based on the external interval
  setting.
* Handle situations where content_type.model_class() returns None.
* Allow extra field types to be added via settings. (Used for coverage view only).
* Improve coverage suggested configs - include 'ignore_empty' settings plus a
  raw code view via /linkcheck/coverage?config=1.
* Fix - correctly handle tags that are inside tags.
* Fix - don't run pre_save if it's a new instance.

1.2 (2015-11-13)

* Added migration folders (missing in the 1.1 package). Also added support for
  South migrations (compatibility).
* When a link produces a 301 Moved Permanently redirection, the redirect target
  is stored in Url.redirect_to and displayed in the link report.
* Better support for URLs containing non-ASCII characters.

1.1 (2015-06-03)

* Minimal software requirements are now Python 2.6 / Django 1.6 (and South 1.0 if
  you still use Django 1.6).
* Python 3 is supported.
* Django 1.7 / 1.8 compatibility added.
* notifications.py is now based on django-admin-blocks.
* Linklist classes now support an ignore_empty list to ignore empty URLField values.

1.0

Changes:

Bug fixes since 0.6 Please see commit log here: https://github.com/andybak/django-linkcheck/commits/master

0.6.0

Changes:

* Support ignoring (and unignoring) external broken links via buttons in the linkcheck report
* 'Recheck' button in the linkcheck report
* External links with anchors were being reported as broken because we switched to a HEAD request
* One particular url caused a crash in urllib2 when doing a HEAD request. Implemented a workaround: catch the exception and run a normal GET
* Inconsistant use of seconds in some places and minutes in others. Switch to minutes for all parameters.
* Clean up CSS
* Use normal links for navigating between report types instead of javascript+radio buttons
* Removed some unused javascript
* Fixed some issues with anchor links
* Broken link notification count was counting urls rather than links
* Mark length of url field configurable for those not cursed with MySQl
* Remove the pointless disinguishing images/documents/other in Url.type
* Document settings properly
* Remove unused pagination tag from template and thus dependency on django-pagination
* All tests now pass ( because I commented out the one that didn't :-P )

Handle get_absolute_url returning None
Use HEAD requests for checking external URLs

Cleaner display of hashtag links in reports
Handle 'Bad Status Line' responses from remote servers.
Don't spawn a thread if running from tests as this prevents the new thread from seeing the same database transaction as the parent thread
Fix some tests from prior to the big refactor. nb Tests are still incomplete and many are broken :(
